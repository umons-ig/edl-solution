# TaskFlow: Task Management Workshops

Series of hands-on workshops for learning CI/CD methods through building a modern task management application.

## 🎯 Project: TaskFlow
A collaborative task management platform where you build a full-stack application from scratch, learning modern development practices at each step.

**Final Result**: A production-ready Kanban-style task manager with team collaboration, real-time updates, and automated deployment.

## 📚 Workshop Series Overview

### **Workshop 1: Python Backend & Testing Fundamentals**
- **Focus**: TDD, FastAPI, pytest, UV environment management
- **Domain**: Core task management API (CRUD operations)
- **Skills**: RESTful APIs, automated testing, error handling
- **Deliverable**: Complete backend service with 95%+ test coverage

### **Workshop 2: TypeScript Frontend & Integration**
- **Focus**: React development, cross-service testing, real-time UI
- **Domain**: Interactive Kanban boards, task visualization
- **Skills**: Component testing, API integration, responsive design
- **Deliverable**: Full-stack application with synchronized frontend/backend

### **Workshop 3: Production & Cloud Deployment**

- **Focus**: Database persistence, cloud deployment, CI/CD automation
- **Domain**: Production configuration, environment management, monitoring
- **Skills**: Cloud databases, GitHub Actions, production deployments
- **Deliverable**: Production-ready application deployed to the cloud

## 🚀 Learning Path

### **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**
1. **Write failing tests (Red)** → Define expected behavior
2. **Implement minimal code (Green)** → Make tests pass
3. **Refactor and optimize** → Improve code quality
4. **Commit and CI/CD** → Automate testing and deployment

### **Technical Stack**
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python 3.11+ + UV package management
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: pytest + Jest + React Testing Library
- **Database**: In-memory → SQLite → PostgreSQL progression
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with multi-service pipelines
- **Containerization**: Docker + docker-compose

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** and **uv** package manager
- **Node.js 18+** and **npm** or **yarn**
- **Git** and **GitHub account**
- **Code editor** (VS Code recommended)
- Basic knowledge of Python and JavaScript
